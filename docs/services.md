# Steps for Using Ductape  

Ductape simplifies building and managing products by focusing on apps, resources, and features. Follow these steps to get started:  


## **1. Install the SDK**  
Begin by installing the Ductape SDK in your project to access its core functionality.  

```bash  
npm install ductape-sdk  
```  

## **2. Create Apps and Import Actions**  
Define the apps your product will use and import their available actions.  
- **Apps:** Represent third-party services like payment gateways, AI Agents, or messaging providers.  
- **Actions:** Individual tasks or operations supported by these apps, such as "Send Email" or "Create Payment."  

## **3. Define App Values**  
Set up key properties for each app:  
- **Constants:** Static values shared across environments or users.  
- **Variables:** Dynamic inputs passed during runtime.  
- **Retry Policies:** Rules to handle failures or retries for app actions.  

## **4. Configure App Resources**  
For each app, configure the necessary resources:  
- **Webhooks:** Define callback URLs for real-time updates.  
- **Events:** Specify triggers for app behavior (e.g., "Order Placed").  
- **Authorization:** Set up authentication methods like API keys or OAuth tokens.  

## **5. Create Products**  
Products in Ductape are logical groupings of apps, resources, and features. Think of them as self-contained systems that deliver specific functionality.  

## **6. Add Apps to Products**  
Integrate any app into a product, allowing them to work together seamlessly.  

## **7. Define Product Resources**  
Set up resources that your product depends on:  
- **Storage:** Configure cloud storage for files or data.  
- **Message Brokers:** Set up messaging queues like RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, Google PubSub, Redis or Kafka.  
- **Databases:** Connect to relational or NoSQL databases, and define database actions (e.g., queries or updates).
- **Notifications:** Configure communication channels and create reusable notification messages.  
- **Jobs:** Define background tasks for asynchronous processing.  
- **Features (Workflows):** Create reusable features by combining actions across apps and resources.  
- **Caches:** Configure caching for frequently accessed data to enhance performance.  

## **8. Use Product Resources in Your Code and Process Events**  
Leverage the product resources you’ve defined to build and execute functionality in your application:  

- **Storage:** Upload, retrieve, or delete files using the Ductape SDK.  
- **Message Brokers:** Publish and subscribe to messages in your queues to enable event-driven architecture.  
- **Databases:** Perform CRUD operations through predefined database actions to manage your product’s data. 
- **Notifications:** Trigger and send notifications based on user actions or system events.  
- **Jobs:** Schedule and execute background jobs to handle asynchronous processing.  
- **Caches:** Retrieve and update cached data to minimize latency and optimize performance.  
- **Features:** Define and use complex workflows using all the above resources
