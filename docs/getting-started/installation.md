## Step 1: Install the Ductape SDK

The Ductape SDK is the core library that allows you to integrate and manage your third-party services seamlessly. To install the SDK, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install @ductape/sdk
```

This command will add the Ductape SDK to your project's dependencies, enabling you to start building products immediately.

## Step 2: Install the Ductape CLI
The Ductape CLI is a powerful tool that provides command-line access to Ductape's features, making it easier to manage and deploy your products. Install the CLI by running:

```bash
npm install ductape-cli
```

With the Ductape CLI installed, you'll have direct access to various commands that streamline your workflow, from creating new products to testing and deploying them.

## Step 3: Make the ductape Command Globally Available
To simplify your workflow, you can make the ductape command available globally on your device. This allows you to use the command from any directory without needing to navigate to your project folder each time. To do this, run the following command:

```
npm link
```
