# Managing Notifications

In your Ductape product, you can send out notifications to your customers using our notifications functionality. We broadly cater to three types of notifications:

- **Push Notifications**
- **Email Notifications**
- **Webhooks/Callback Notifications**
- **Smses**

### Push Notifications
Push Notifications are simple, clickable messages sent directly to users' devices from your products. They appear in real-time and can be used to notify users about important updates, alerts, or promotional offers. Users must opt-in to receive these notifications, and they can be sent even when the user isn't actively using the app.

### Email Notifications
Email Notifications allow you to communicate with your users via email. These can be used for account-related information, marketing campaigns, or transactional emails like purchase confirmations. You can customize the content and layout of the email to suit your productâ€™s needs.

### Webhooks/Callback Notifications
Webhooks or Callback Notifications are used to send real-time data to third-party systems or other apps. When a specific event occurs in your product, the system can trigger a callback to a specified URL, allowing seamless integration with external services. This is ideal for syncing data or triggering automated workflows in other systems.

### SMS Notifications

SMS Notifications allow you to send text messages directly to your users' mobile phones through one of the supported SMS providers (Twilio, Vonage, or Plivo).  

These notifications are useful for instant alerts, OTP delivery, status updates, and promotional content. SMS notifications use **parameterised string templates**, allowing you to personalize the message with dynamic values.
