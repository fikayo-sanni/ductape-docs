# Getting Started with Products

Products in Ductape combine app actions and reusable components to deliver advanced functionality within your applications. By leveraging products, you can create custom logic using reusable components, while incorporating actions from multiple sources. This allows you to build sophisticated features and workflows without developing everything from scratch.

With Ductape, products provide a seamless way to extend your platform’s capabilities, offering greater flexibility and control over your development process. Whether you’re combining data from different APIs, orchestrating complex business processes, or enhancing your microservices architecture, products help you efficiently build and maintain robust solutions.

## Product Resources

### Apps

- **Public Apps**: External apps available on the Ductape marketplace.

To use these apps, you need to set up and configure them for your product.

### Databases

### Cloud Functions
Ductape supports reusable functions written in Node.js, with plans to expand language support. Functions streamline processes by encapsulating logic that can be executed within the platform, promoting code reuse across workflows.

### Caches
Ductape offers tools to build and manage data caches, optimizing performance by reducing the need for repeated data retrieval. Caching ensures faster execution of tasks, minimizing redundant operations and conserving resources.

### Features
Features in Ductape are collections of sequences that can be executed either in a defined order or concurrently, depending on your configuration. By combining various components like functions, products, and jobs, you can create scalable workflows that enhance your platform’s functionality.

### Quotas
Quotas in Ductape allow you to share loads between different providers easily and conveniently. Define multiple providers for an action, and share the load amongst them seamlessly in ratios of your own choosing

### Fallbacks
Fallbacks in Ductape allow you to be more resilient in execution, in case one provider goes down, easily swap to another provider while getting the same customizable output from both

### Message Brokers
Ductape integrates with all the popular message brokers, enabling you to process and handle messages asynchronously. This is useful for event-driven architectures and allows for better scalability by decoupling processes and also helps with switching between multiple brokers seamlessly

### Storage
Ductape provides storage resources that enable you to upload, store, and manage files within your product. This makes it easy to handle files, such as images, documents, or any other type of data, as part of your workflows and also helps with switching between storage providers seamlessly
