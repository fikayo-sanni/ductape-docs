# Introducing Ductape

## Reusable, Portable, and Environment Agnostic Backend Logic
Ductape is a developer-first framework for defining backend behavior like database operations, API calls, message queues, notifications, and scheduled jobs as modular, configurable units that can run across any environment.

Instead of hardcoding logic into each service, you write it once and extract environment-specific details like credentials, endpoints, and retries into as configuration. The result is portable backend behavior that works locally, in staging, or in production without needing to rewrite anything.

You continue using your preferred tools and providers. Ductape simply provides a consistent way to organize and interact with them.

## Why Ductape
Write Once, Run Anywhere

Move faster by eliminating duplicated logic across services. Whether it is consuming a message queue, calling an API, or running reconciliation jobs, you define the logic once and run it anywhere.

**Supports All Backend Components**

### Use Ductape to manage:
-	Database queries and transactions
-	Message broker consumers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)
-	Long-running or scheduled jobs
-	External APIs like Stripe or Twilio
-	Internal shared logic used across services

### Developer Focused and Code First
Ductape is a framework you write in code. It is flexible, transparent, and built to scale with you.
Think of it like what Docker does for packaging apps or what Terraform does for infrastructure. Ductape brings that same approach to backend logic.


### Key Benefits
-	Modular and reusable components across environments, projects, and teams
-	Consistent testing workflows in dedicated environments
-	Built-in monitoring and logs to debug and trace behavior
-	Faster iteration without duplicating logic or wiring

### In Summary
Ductape helps you write backend logic once, make it environment agnostic, and reuse it anywhere.
It gives your team a cleaner, faster, and more consistent way to build and scale backend systems.
